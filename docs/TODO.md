### **Core API PoC Completion: 100%** ✅
### **Full PoC Completion: 70%** (Missing deployment & orchestration phases)
- [ ] Azure AD JWT validation troubleshooting

---

## ⚠️ **Known Issues & Technical Debt**

### **Blocking Issues**
- 🚨 **GraphQL Mutations**: StrawberryField error preventing all CRUD operations
- 🚨 **Authentication**: Azure AD integration disabled due to JWT validation errors
- 🚨 **No Containerization**: API not containerized or deployed to Azure
- 🚨 **Missing Orchestration**: No Logic Apps implemented (0% of orchestration requirements)

### **Technical Debt**
- Limited error handling in resolvers
- No input validation beyond basic types
- No automated testing coverage
- No API documentation generation
- No performance optimization
